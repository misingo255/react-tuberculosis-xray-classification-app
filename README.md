## Features

- **Image Classification**: The app employs a machine learning model to classify tuberculosis X-ray images accurately.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React-based interface ensures a seamless user experience.
- **Fast Loading**: Built with Vite, the application loads swiftly, providing quick responses to user interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/misingo255/react-tuberculosis-xray-classification-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd react-tuberculosis-xray-classification-app
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
